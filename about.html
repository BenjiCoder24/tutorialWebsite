            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about programming, teaching, and exploring. I love to teach and see how my students grow and how we can change the world. We aim to provide high-quality, accessible programming tutorials to students in the Philippines. Our tutorials are designed to cater to learners at various levels, from beginners to advanced programmers.</p>
            
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin Mager, and I live in NY. I am a passionate educator and software developer dedicated to promoting technology education. Together with a team of skilled contributors and educators, we strive to offer the best learning experience.</p>
            
            <h2>Support Team</h2>
            <p>While we do not have formal partners, I am supported in this endeavor by my sister, who is a student, and my high school CS teacher. Both have been instrumental in developing the content and providing insights that enhance the educational value of our tutorials.</p>
